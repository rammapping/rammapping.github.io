        <h2>Short on time?</h2>
        <p>
            Use the map to find where you live.
            Then find a couple of the closest hunting locations to your home.
            Review the DNR resources, regulations, etc for your locations. 
            Then examine the charts to learn about the harvests and hunter behaviors for those areas.
            Contact the DNR if you have questions.
            Make your best plan, work with what you have available to you, and go hunt. 
            Good luck!

        <h2>What is "Season Day"?</h2>
        <p>
            How do you get many seasons of data to correctly overlap for comparing harvests across years? 
            Seasons don't start on the same weekday every year and they don't end on the same weekday every year. 
            You want to compare a Saturday to a Saturday if you want to understand hunter behavior. 
            For example, October 27 could be a Monday one year and a Saturday the next year and we all know which day sees more hunters in the woods.
        </p>
        <p> We settled on Thanksgiving day as the key. Thanksgiving day is "Season Day" zero (0).
            It's a day in the season, every season, that falls on the same day of the week. 
            Also, opening day of firearm always follows two days after Thanksgiving Thursday.
            By using Thanksgiving day as the zero day, the numbers from the biggest harvest day of every season always line up. 
            Season lengths vary year to year but the same weekdays of data always line up for us this way. 
        </p>
        <h2>Why aren't all hunting locations on the map?</h2>
        <p>
            We focused on mapping the smaller, typically tough to find areas.  
            Large areas like a state park or forest are easily found on the internet.
