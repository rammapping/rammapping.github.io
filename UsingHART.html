            Use the map to find where you live.
            Then find a couple of the closest to you hunting locations.
            Review the DNR resources, regulations, etc for locations of interest. 
            Then examine the charts to learn about the harvests and hunter behaviors for those areas.
            Make your best plan and work with what you have available to you. 
            Good luck!
