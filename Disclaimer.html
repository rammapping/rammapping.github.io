        <h1>DISCLAIMER</h1>
        <p>
            We aren't authorities on anything. 
            The point locations on the map are just spots that looked close to the hunting locations.
            They are not to be trusted as authoritative or used for navigation purposes.
            They are just supposed to get you near to the hunting spots so you can start your own investigating.
            HART is just a different way of looking at the DNR information so it's easier to find where to go, from our viewpoint.
            On top of DNR information we added some analysis which can only be as good as the input data from the DNR and is inevitably worse due to our inexperience in working with data.
        </p>
        <p>
            You must use DNR resources for authoritative information.
            When in doubt, look to the DNR.
            Not sure about something, ask the DNR.
            We are not responsible for any choices you make. Go to the DNR first for answers and help. 
            They are the experts and authority on everything this site pertains to.
            We have no authority and no responsibility for your actions.
