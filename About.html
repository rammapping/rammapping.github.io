            We are a small group of hunters with jobs, adult obligations, and familes we don't want to be apart from.
            We love the woods but we don't like to "waste" our time. 
            Getting skunked time and again sours the hunting experience and leads to questions from significant others.
            After all, more squirrel watching is easily done through your office or home windows.

            We came to public hunting from limited private land hunting. 
            We were inspired by <a href="https://www.thehuntingpublic.com/" target="_blank">The Hunting Public crew.</a>
            We found the transition to public land intimidating.
            We found it hard to do basic things like just figuring out where we could go hunt.
            Once out there, we found it difficult to connect with the deer under public pressures.
            We slowly realized that to understand the deer, who were patterning and adapting to hunters, it would help to understand hunter patterns ourselves.

            Around 2018 we went to work learning how to look at data. That eventually lead to learning how to web program.
            We very slowly made ourselves some useful tools and began to see their value.
            It's been a long road and we've definitely traded time in the woods for time spent at computers.
            Turns out, by the way, it's easier to learn to work with data and websites than to connect with a mature buck.
        </p>
        <p> As time passed, we started meeting other hunters on public that were friendly and encountering our same challenges.
            It became obvious to us that we're all out there matching wits with adaptive, attuned creatures who beat us more often than not.
            That's when we started thinking maybe we should share our tools and give to the public land community we have become a part of.
