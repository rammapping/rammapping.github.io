            In the beginning, we hunted small private properties in urban areas. We struggled to connect with deer so we decided to analyze our
            game camera photos and try to make sense of deer patterns. We noticed that the deer patterns appeared to be sensitive to the normal daily 
            and weekly patterns of human activity in the surrounding area. Our hunts became more successful.
            Then, around 2018, we lost our private land setup and made the move to public land hunting. The transition to public land was intimidating 
            and we found it hard to just figure out where we could go hunt in Maryland. Once afield, we found it difficult to connect with the deer
            under public pressures, just like our private land experience. We took what we learned from our private 
            land experience and applied it to public lands using harvest and reservation data. We knew that to better understand the deer, 
            who were patterning and adapting to hunters, we needed to understand hunter patterns ourselves. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In those early days we found ourselves asking some basic questions like...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How are other hunters doing out there and were they facing the same challenges as us?</li>
            <li>How was the harvestable deer population changing at an area as the season progressed?</li>
            <li>Can we see patterns in hunter behavior and even discover overlooked opportunities?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            We looked at data, made digital tools, and started trying to get answers to our questions.
            As we met other hunters on public, it became obvious that we weren't alone.
            That's when we started thinking our tools might be useful to others.
            It's been a lot of work and learning, we've definitely traded woods time for computer time,
            but we've improved our hunting experiences and are growing HART. Hope it helps some of you all. Happy hunting.
