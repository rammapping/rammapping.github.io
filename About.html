        <h1>About RAM & HART</h1>
        <p>
            RAM is just a small group of hunters like you. 
            We all have responsibilities like jobs, adult obligations, and families competing for our limited time. 
            We love our escape to the woods but we don't like to "waste" our time.
            Getting skunked time and again gets old and leads to questions from significant others and bosses.
            After all, more squirrel watching is easily done through your office or home windows.

            We came to public hunting from limited private land hunting opportunities. 
            We were inspired by <a href="https://www.thehuntingpublic.com/" target="_blank">The Hunting Public</a>.
            We all found the transition to public land intimidating.
            We found it hard to do basic things like just figuring out where we could go hunt.
            Once out there, we found it difficult to connect with the deer under public pressures.
            We know how to find trails, scrapes, rubs, food sources but something was different than private.
            We slowly realized that to understand the deer, who were patterning and adapting to hunters, it would help to understand hunter patterns ourselves.

            Around 2018 we went to work learning how to work with data and that eventually lead to learning how to web program.
            We very slowly made ourselves some useful tools and began to see their value.
            It's been a long road and we've definitely traded time in the woods for time spent at computers.
            Turns out, by the way, it's easier to learn to work with data and websites than to connect with a mature buck on public land.
        </p>
        <p> As time passed, we met other hunters on public that were struggling just like us.
            It became obvious that we're all out there matching wits with adaptive, attuned creatures who beat us more often than not.
            And just like any Fox or Coyote etc will tell you, it's tough being the predator.
            That's when we started thinking our tool might be useful to others and decided to share it with the public land hunting community we have become a part of.

        <p>
            It's taken a lot of work, it's not perfect, and we hope to keep it going.
