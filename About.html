        <p>
            RAM is a small group of hunters. 
            We all have lifes responsibilities competing for our limited time. 
            We love our woods time but agree that we don't like to "waste" that time getting skunked hunt after hunt after hunt.
        </p>
        <p>
            We came to public land hunting from private land hunting opportunities. 
            We were inspired by <a href="https://www.thehuntingpublic.com/" target="_blank">The Hunting Public</a>.
            Each one of us found the transition to public land intimidating and found it hard to do basic things like just figuring out where we could go hunt in Maryland.
            Once afield, we found it difficult to connect with the deer under public pressures.
            We knew how to find trails, scrapes, rubs, food sources but slowly realized that to better understand the deer, who were patterning and adapting to hunters, 
            it would help to understand hunter patterns ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Around 2018 we started learning how to work with data and that eventually lead to learning how to program.
            We slowly made ourselves some useful tools and began to see their value.
            It's been a lot of work and learning, we've definitely traded woods time for computer time,
            but we've improved our hunting experiences and created HART.
        </p>
        <p> As we met other hunters on public like us, it became obvious that 
            we're all out there struggling to connect with adaptive attuned animals... who are beating us more often than not.
            That's when we started thinking our tool might be useful to others in the public land hunting community.
