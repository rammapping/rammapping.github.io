            RAM is a small group of hunters.
            We came to public land hunting from small private land hunting opportunities. 
            Each one of us found the transition to public land intimidating and found it hard to do basic things like just figuring out where we could go hunt in Maryland.
            Once afield, we found it difficult to connect with the deer under public pressures.
            We knew how to scout but slowly realized that to better understand the deer, who were patterning and adapting to hunters, 
            it would help to understand hunter patterns ourselves.
            We found ourselves asking things like how are other hunters doing, were they facing challenges like us, 
            and how was the harvestable deer population changing as the season progressed? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting around 2018, we started trying to get answers to our questions.
            We looked at data and made digital tools and began to see their value.
            As we met other hunters on public like us, it became obvious that we weren't alone.
            That's when we started thinking our tool might be useful to others.
            It's been a lot of work and learning, we've definitely traded woods time for computer time,
            but we've improved our hunting experiences and created HART.
            Hope it helps some of you all. Happy hunting.
