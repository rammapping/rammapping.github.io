        <p>
            About 2018, we made the move to public land hunting from small private land hunting opportunities.
            The transition to public land was intimidating and we found it hard to just figure out where we could go hunt in Maryland.
            Once afield, we found it difficult to connect with the deer under public pressures.
            We knew how to scout but slowly realized that to better understand the deer, who were patterning and adapting to hunters, 
            it would help to understand hunter patterns ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            We found ourselves asking some basic questions like...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How are other hunters doing out there and were they facing the same challenges as us?</li>
            <li>How was the harvestable deer population changing at an area as the season progressed?</li>
            <li>Can we see patterns in hunter behavior and even discover overlooked opportunities?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            We looked at data, made digital tools, and started trying to get answers to our questions.
            As we met other hunters on public, it became obvious that we weren't alone.
            That's when we started thinking our tool might be useful to others.
            It's been a lot of work and learning, we've definitely traded woods time for computer time,
            but we've improved our hunting experiences and are growing HART. Hope it helps some of you all. Happy hunting.
