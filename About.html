        <h1>About RAM & HART</h1>
        <p>
            RAM is a small group of hunters. 
            We all have responsibilities like jobs, adult obligations, and families competing for our limited time. 
            We love our escape to the woods but we don't like to "waste" our time getting skunked hunt after hunt after hunt.
        </p>
        <p>
            We came to public hunting from private land hunting opportunities. 
            We were inspired by <a href="https://www.thehuntingpublic.com/" target="_blank">The Hunting Public</a>.
            We all found the transition to public land intimidating and we found it hard to do basic things like just figuring out where we could go hunt.
            Once afield, we found it difficult to connect with the deer under public pressures.
            We know how to find trails, scrapes, rubs, food sources but slowly realized that to understand the deer, who were patterning and adapting to hunters, 
            we needed to understand hunter patterns ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Around 2018 we went to work learning how to work with data and that eventually lead to learning how to web program.
            We slowly made ourselves some useful tools and began to see their value.
            It's been a long road and we've definitely traded time in the woods for time spent at computers, but we've accomplished our goal and improved our hunting.
        </p>
        <p> As we met other hunters on public that were struggling like us it became obvious that 
            we're all out there matching wits with adaptive, attuned creatures who are beating us more often than not.
            That's when we started thinking our tool might be useful to others in the public land hunting community we have become a part of.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's taken a lot of work, it's not perfect, we hope to keep going.
